*This is Part 3 of my experience buying a Nissan Leaf. Check-out [Part 1][1] and [Part 2][2].*

Nissan sells the Leaf in three trim levels: S, SV and SL. Generally when you see a super-low lease ($199/month) for a brand-new Leaf, they are talking about a Base S model. I spent quite a bit of time going over all three of the trims. Sometimes I felt like a S would work fine, other times I'd gravitate up to the SL. I also learned a few surpising things and I hope this information helps you figure out what trim level will work for you. Bear in mind, this information pertains to the 2013 Nissan Leaf.

### S ($28,980 MSRP)

This is the base trim and it seems pretty popular. The motor (80 kW) and battery (24 kWh) are **identical** across all trim levels. You can't pay more for a better engine or better battery. This trim level also include:

* Rear-view monitor
* Heated seats and heated steering wheels

I get the impression that people who buy this trim are buying a Leaf as their "second car". 

### SV ($32,000 MSRP)

This is the trim level we settled on. Here are some of the additional features you get:

* Hybrid heater system (heats the car using a separate battery)
* B-mode (regenerative braking drive mode)
* 7-inch touch screen with Navigation
* CARWINGS remote connection

Here is where I found a massive surprise: the 2013 SV and SL **do not include a rear-view monitor!** Yes, the thing that comes standard on their base model is not standard on the SV or SL. This was pretty astounding to discover. Unfortunately for me, I discovered this while at the dealership trying to close on my purchase. This was a huge error on my part and really put me in a poor negotiating position. The only way you can obtain a rear-view monitor at these trim levels is to add the Premium package ($1,050 MSRP) which includes their Around View Monitor and an upgraded Bose speaker system.

I thought about it for 5 minutes and decided that the rear-view camera was important so I added on the Premium package. Of course the dealership didn't have any of those in stock so they had to reach out to the Nissan dealer network and locate one. That's a story for another post.

In addition to the Premium package I added on the QC/LED package ($1,630 MSRP). This included:

* A quick charge port
* LED headlights

I felt that in order for the Leaf to be a realistic primary vehicle for our family that we needed to get the quick charge port. You can charge a Leaf to 80% charge at a quick charge station in about 30 minutes. There is a [growing network of quick charge stations][3] lining most of the major highways. I'm hoping that some smart planning can make road trips around the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Vancouver, etc) a viable option.

### SL ($35,020)

Finally, the trim level we didn't choose. I guess after 2.5 years in a beautiful leather vehicle (2011 VW Tiguan), I realized that it just didn't mix well with kids and car seats. And that's the primary upgrade for the SL trim level: leather seats. The other additional features aren't very meaningful: a spoiler with a solar panel on it that doesn't do much, slightly larger wheels and a cargo cover.

**NEXT TIME:** I'll talk about the process I used to contact local dealers and close on the purchase. I'll also dive into some of the numbers behind my lease.
