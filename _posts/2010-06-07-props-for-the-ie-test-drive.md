<p>From a <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/06/apples-html5-showcase-less-about-web-standards-more-about-apple/">recent Webmonkey post</a> about Apple&#8217;s decision to block non-Safari browsers from their HTML5 demos:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft recently published <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/" target="_blank">its own HTML5 showcase</a> to hype the coming release of Internet Explorer 9, and its demo pages are viewable (and work) in any non-IE browser with the proper support. Mozilla's <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/demo/featured-demo/" target="_blank">HTML5 demo pages</a> are geared to work with experimental builds of Firefox, but at least other browsers aren't blocked, and most of the demos actually work in Chrome.</p></blockquote>
